Hi, I'm Erik. I'm a fullstack developer specializing in React, GatsbyJS, and NodeJS. For the past 5 years, I have been building scalable websites and web applications in the security and backup sector.

## How I can help you
If you have a small business that needs a web presence, I can help build you a website to show off to your customers what your business is all about.  The process will look something like this:
* Learning Phase: Learn about your business, and see how I might be able to help boost your web presence
* Design Phase: Create mockups and iterate on those design until you are satisfied with the result
* Build Phase: Implement those designs and add content to your site.  You will have access to control the content of your site, while I will handle the nitty gritty technical details of design, hosting, scaling, etc..
* Support Phase: Once the website is stable and you are happy with the result, I will continue to support it and add features as they come up, or hand it off to you if preferable

## Technologies I use
If you are interested in the nitty gritty details of how I will build your site, please read on.

### Design
During the design phase, I will be creating UX mockups which will eventually become the layout of your site.  I use a program called [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to rapidly create mockups which I can send to you and get feedback.  

### Building
To build your website, I will use a framework called [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)  
Gatsby is a wonderful tool that allows for building static websites using [React](https://www.reactjs.org) components within code.  This allows better code reusability, and empowers me to give your website a consistent look and feel.  It also allows me to develop your website on any machine, so there is no need to have dedicated development servers that become a single point of failure.

### Content Management System (CMS)
In order to empower you to manage the content on your site, I need to use a CMS to host all of your content.  My CMS of choice is [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).  You will be given access to a web portal where you can make changes to any aspect of your site (pictures, files, text, posts), preview, and deploy them without any web development knowledge.  The interface is simple, user friendly, and a delight to use.

#### What about Wordpress or Squarespace?

Wordpress and Squarespace are great! However they are limited in the out of the box functionality, and you may have a use case that is not suited for those workflows. By using GatsbyJS, I can give you everything you need out of a CMS (content management system), as well as the ability to make a full fledged web application on your site. This increases the power that your site can have for your users. You can add custom functionality specific to your business with ease, and because React is such a well known framework for web development, it can be easily maintained.

### Hosting
We can host the website wherever you would like! The great thing about GatsbyJS is that there are no dependencies on PHP or MySQL.  My perferred method is using Netlify's built in hosting platform.  It is secure and scalable, and it takes the pain our of maintaining servers.  However, we can just as easily drop your site onto any major cloud provider, or even a privately hosted physical server
