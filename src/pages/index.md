Hi, I'm Erik.  I'm a fullstack developer specializing in React, GatsbyJS, and NodeJS.  For the past 5 years, I have been building scalable web applications in the security and backup sector.

I have spent my time focusing on the user facing side of applications (React, AngularJS).  This includes designing and creating intuitive UIs, and implementing them in a scalable and maintainable way.  I pride myself on writing code that can be easily maintained by new developers by sticking to best practices and clearly documenting my designs.

## How can I help you?
Do you have a small business that needs a web presence? I want to work with you to design a website that feels unique to your company, and at the same time will be able to grow as your business grows.  I also want to make sure you are in control of the content on your site.  Using technologies like GatsbyJS and NetlifyCMS, you will be able to preview and deploy content as you see fit.

## What about Wordpress or Squarespace?
Wordpress and Squarespace are great! However they are limited in the out of the box functionality, and you may have a use case that is not suited for those workflows.  By using GatsbyJS, I can give you everything you need out of a CMS (content management system), as well as the ability to make a full fledged web application on your site.  This increases the power that your site can have for your users.  You can add custom functionality specific to your business with ease, and because React is such a well known framework for web development, it can be easily maintained.
